## Structure

### Criteria

Submission Requirements

## CSS Separate From HTML

Portfolio completely separates structure from design/style.
There are no attributes present in the body of the document.
There are no elements in the document.

## CSS Imports

There should be at least 3 imported files in the main CSS file, but the student is welcome to break it down even further if that makes it easier for them.

## Directories & Files

Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on page and functionality.
The main index.html page should be in the directory's root.
All static assets should be placed in a folder called static/ or assets/.

## Links

Each page has an intentional user flow with appropriate links as needed.

Tip: The homepage, design system, and blog post all contain links to each other. The Homepage should have fake links, such as "About", "Search", and "Subscribe".
